Limitations of the script:

The script is not abel to recognize seqeunces that have sequencing uncertainties ('nN') within the recognition sites in the beginning or the end. 


Trouble Shooting:

1. Sequences are not analyzed on amino acid level:
	* Make sure that the sequence you are trying to read in contains a start codon. The first start codon within the sequence is used to determine the reading frame.
